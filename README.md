# iptables-personal-whitelist

I have two types or resources for IPtables blacklists within HestiaCP.

#### 1. Local blacklists based on a .sh script. The files are hosted locally on the server.

    root@host: cd /usr/local/hestia/data/firewall/ipset/
  
- asn-personal-blacklist.sh
  
#### 2. Remote blacklists based on a .txt file. These files are hosted on f.e. Github.
